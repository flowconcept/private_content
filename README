Drupal 8 version of the Private module.

All code is in the private_content module because private is a reserved keyword in PHP.

Private is a very simple node access module that gives each node a 'private' checkbox. If it's set, it can only be seen by the node author, or users with the 'see all private nodes' permission. It's most useful on small sites with limited needs, like single user blogs that want to hide a few posts from the general public without the overhead of a comprehensive access management module.
